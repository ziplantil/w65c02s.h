Notes about w65c02s and its development:
* The RESET/RST behaviour is not completely accurate, but at least the NMOS
  6502 has unpredictable behavior during a reset anyway. It seems to do 2
  spurious reads of PC before the third (first read of RESET), but in addition
  to that, the current instruction gets run partially and often throws complete
  nonsense onto the address bus. How the CMOS 65C02 behaves is uncertain.
  I have chosen not to emulate the weird RESET behavior and instead it is
  triggered instantly after the end of an instruction.
* For some reason, -O2 and -O3 are consistently *slower* on gcc than -O1. This
  seems to occur due to -ftree-tail-merge, which causes extra range checks to
  be added to switch statements, despite __builtin_unreachable() being used.
  Is this a gcc bug?
* The case of W65C02SCE_COARSE=0 could be optimized greatly by eliminating
  the "cont = 0" branch entirely, but that does not seem possible in C89, even
  with compiler extensions.
