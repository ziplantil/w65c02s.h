==== w65c02sce -- cycle-accurate WDC 65C02S emulator in portable C =============

This library (in src/) is designed to be statically linked, but
in theory it could be dynamically linked as well.

==== Features ==================================================================
* Portable C (C89, only freestanding headers in main library code)
* Supports all W65C02S instructions (6502, CMOS, Rockwell bit, WAI+STP)
* High accuracy, down to memory read/write level
* High performance, optimized well by compilers
* (If enabled by flag) Can stop mid-instruction when running cycle by cycle

==== Tests =====================================================================
* Passes both the 6502 functional test and 65c02 extended opcodes
  tests by Klaus Dormann

==== Errata ====================================================================
* Cycle/bus accuracy and interrupt timing may not yet be perfect.
* All accesses to the same CPU must be done by the same thread.
  Multithreaded access on the same CPU will result in undefined behavior.

==== Building ==================================================================
* Statically linked. See docs/defines.md for defines.
* test/ contains testing programs (like monitor, build with make monitor).

==== License ===================================================================
